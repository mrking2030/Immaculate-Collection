Immaculate Conception

Out of a frying pan...
And into fire...

Out of which rises...
A phoenix...

Like the transformation of a caterpillar into…
A butterfly...

Like a sand irritation inside of an oyster becomes...
A pearl...

Like coal compressed for thousands of years becomes...
A diamond...



Like we were born to live through our struggle and pain
in this life...

Our struggle to learn in this life…



And to stand victorious one with it all.





Immaculate!


Free now together and in the moment next…
